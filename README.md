# AI Choreography
Files stored:
- Folder model: the code related to the core encoder decoder sturcture of the algorithm
- Folder music_features: the music features extracted with madmom, which can be directly feed into the model

Model:
* Stage 1: CAU prediction: CAU_prediction.ipynb, utils.py
* Stage 2 (work in progress): the other files
